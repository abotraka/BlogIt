            Ahmed Khaled Tawfik was more than a fiction writer, he was a
            phenomenon who showed a generation of young readers a whole new
            world

            The story of Egyptian horror and science fiction writer Ahmed Khaled
            Tawfik is easily told through the stories of his audience, most of
            whom grew up in the 1990s and the early 2000s. It is the story of
            those who regularly slipped his books into their school bags and
            read them secretly when their teacher was not paying attention, or
            from behind a school book they pretended to read while they enjoyed
            the adventures of the 60-year-old Refaat Ismail, Tawfik's most
            famous character. It is the story of those who saved their tiny
            allowance every day to buy their next book from his successful
            series Ma Wara' Al-Tabi'a (Metaphysics), which was sold at an
            affordable price. It is the also the story of thousands of young
            people who are mourning the shocking and sudden death of their
            beloved writer, who left without a warning, as well as those who met
            him and those who only knew him through his words. Tawfik, who
            departed our world on 2 April at 55 after suffering a heart attack
            at a Cairo hospital, left more than just his books, he left a
            generation of young readers, whose ages now range between the
            twenties and the late thirties. These fans might not have read a
            book in their lives if it were not for Tawfik, who attracted them
            and showed them a whole new world, not only through his entertaining
            and educated writing, but also the novel genre of literature that he
            loved and insisted on pursuing despite initial rejection. This was
            horror, fantasy and science fiction, which captured the imagination
            of every school kid from the mid 90s to this day. Born in 1962 in
            Tanta, Tawfik graduated from the faculty of medicine and became a
            doctor specialised in tropical medicine, before he decided to turn
            to writing. He submitted his first horror book draft in 1992, Masas
            Al-Demaa w Ostorat alragol El Ze’b (The Vampire and the Legend of
            the Wolf Man), to a Cairo publishing house named The Modern Arab
            Association, which targeted teen audiences with pocket novels, such
            as the hit action series Ragol El-Mostaheel (The Man of the
            Impossible) by Nabil Farouk. The initial draft was rejected by a
            committee formed by the publisher, and Tawfik was told to stick to
            more established genres, such as police fiction, action and military
            style novels. However, Tawfik insisted on pursuing his passion until
            a new committee was formed and approved the draft, which saw the
            light of day later that year. The book became the first in one of
            the most popular pocket book series in Egypt; Ma Wara' Al-Tabi'a. As
            his audience grew up, Tawfik kept up with them, moving into new
            forms of writing, transitioning from short pocket novels and
            illustrated stories to longer and more complicated books, such as
            Utopia (2008). With the internet, social media, the opening of
            bookstore chains, and the new tradition of book signing events in
            the early 2000s, his readers got to know the man whose small picture
            adorned the back of every pocket book. This was the writer who told
            them the exotic stories and adventures of the old man Refaat Ismail,
            who many of us thought of as Tawfik himself, back in the 90s when he
            was not on TV or social media. This was a time when getting to meet
            the author was a far-fetched idea. As the audience got to know him
            in the flesh, they discovered his very humble personality; not only
            was he willing to talk to anyone and get to know and participate in
            any event for his readers, but he also welcomed even the harshest
            criticism of his work from those who snubbed him and his genre.
            Tawfik showed many people how to read, and affected the conscience
            of a generation. His impact is a phenomenon worthy of study.

            CAIRO - 4 April 2018: On Monday, I had that burning feeling of
            losing a friend without saying goodbye. Once I learned that Dr.
            Ahmed Khaled Tawfik passed away, I felt that I lost an old friend
            who I haven’t heard from in a long time, but still have a deep
            appreciation for in my heart. I was introduced to Tawfik’s writings
            through my friends. I was fascinated by his easy language and pure
            imagination that smoothly touched the mind of a 9-year-old child –
            most of my generation started reading Tawfik’s books at this age –
            and I got hooked. His books never left me alone during my family
            trips, summer vacations and before closing my eyes to sleep.
          </p>
          <h3>You don't need to be super to be a hero</h3>
          <p>
            Every month I was anticipating the new episode of the pocket-sized
            epic series “Ma Wara Al-Tabia” (Supernatural Phenomenon) to follow
            up on the new adventure of his protagonist, Dr. Refaat Ismail, an
            old doctor with the lowest physical characteristics and average IQ.
          </p>

          <p class="quote">
            <b>Refaat</b>
            Dr. Refaat was not wealthy, lucky or masculine, and for sure wasn’t
            handsome, but he was a deep thinker and realistic man with a big
            heart to love one woman deeply and eternally – Magy. He made an
            entire generation believe that one can be a hero without a
            superpower.
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            <b>Refaat</b>
            <b>He made the youth read</b>
            Tawfik was an honest man, but he used to write about the
            extraordinary phenomenon, sci-fi classics and horror stories that
            you can always learn something from. After experiencing a
            life-changing heart attack in 2011, Tawfik talked more about death
            and predicted his end; he even predicted the date of his funeral –
            April 3 – in one of his articles. In another article, Tawfik
            expressed his will to have “He made the youth read” written on his
            own tombstone, a wish that was fulfilled by one of his faithful
            readers.
          </p>

          <p class="quote">
            <b>Tawfik</b>
            He even predicted the sorrow and pain in his funeral, saying, “My
            funeral will be beautiful and moving; unfortunately I will not see
            it, although I will certainly be there.”
            <b>The approach with the youth of January 25 Revolution</b>
            As usual, Tawfik did not miss the chance to share in the revolution
            of the generation he wrote for, so he wrote “Senja – Knife” in 2012,
            the sad, pessimistic, unfortunate novel about a girl who commits
            suicide and a failed novelist who tries to decode the mystery of her
            death by approaching the reality she lived in. The ugly, painful
            society Tawfik described was an extreme description of
            pre-revolution Egypt, in an attempt to unveil the reality
            surrounding the youth who rose from the ashes to lead this great
            revolution.
